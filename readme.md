# TheBlueRuby.Github.io - For Old Browsers

**Visit <http://theblueruby.github.io/old-browsers/> instead!**

A "Fork" of my [github pages site](http://theblueruby.github.io/) that replaces all the CSS3 with CSS2 and removes Bootstrap  
This was created because I wanted to see how my site performs on my 3DS, but it doesn't support CSS3  
This should also work on IE

Originally the OldCSS branch of the original repo, but GitHub Pages doesn't like publishing from 2 branches of the same repo at the same time.
